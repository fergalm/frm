Filter tracings for JWST

Nircam filters are availabe at URL
Wavelength units are in microns


MIRI filters are available at http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/MIRI/pces.htm
in an excel file.

The script miri.py extracts the per-filter files. The wavelength units are
metres, and the 1st column is the fraction of electrons to photons at each
wavelength. I believe this is the format all my other filters are in, but the 
URL above suggests converting to Watts.
