The original file from which I created the 2 column format spectrum

For Sloan filters, data taken from http://cochiguaz.lco.cl/~gmartin/instr_operations/filters/opt_filters.html (not an official source)

Johnson I taken from http://www.ctio.noao.edu/telescopes/1m/filters/i_yalo.txt


WISE filters from
http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/prelim/expsup/sec4_3g.html#WISEZMA
(see Fig 4a)


#Galex from

These curves are in effective area, for some reason.
http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~capak/cosmos/filters/index.html
Gives "QE" curves, so I use these values to normalise from cm^2 to fraction
of light recorded

fuv *= .3507/34.0988
nuv *= .5622/56.218399047852

tail -n +2 galexnuv.txt  | awk '{print $1*1e-10, $2*.5622/56.218399047852}' > ../galexnuv.txt


#JWST nircam filters are at 
https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-near-infrared-camera/nircam-instrumentation/nircam-filters#NIRCamFilters-filt_trans
I've only downloaded a couple. Convert to std format with
